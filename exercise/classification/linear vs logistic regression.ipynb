    "## What is the difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the <b>most probable class</b> for that data point. For this, we use <b>Logistic Regression</b>.\n",

    "    As you know, <b>Linear regression</b> finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, <b>y</b>, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 + \\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "and finds the values of parameters $\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2$, etc, where the term $\\theta_0$ is the \"intercept\". It can be generally shown as:\n",

    "Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, <b>y</b>, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function ùúé:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "‚Ñé_\\theta(ùë•) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) =  \\frac {e^{(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 +...)}}{1 + e^{(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 +\\cdots)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Or:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ProbabilityOfaClass_1 =  P(Y=1|X) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) = \\frac{e^{\\theta^TX}}{1+e^{\\theta^TX}} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, ${\\theta^TX}$ is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), `exp` is the exponential function and $\\sigma(\\theta^TX)$ is the sigmoid or [logistic function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function), also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability:\n",

    "The objective of __Logistic Regression__ algorithm, is to find the best parameters Œ∏, for $‚Ñé_\\theta(ùë•)$ = $\\sigma({\\theta^TX})$, in such a way that the model best predicts the class of each case."
